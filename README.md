# Faas-tasks: Optimized Resource Management for FaaS platforms

Faas-tasks is a research project whose aim is to explore resource management strategies for modern and upcoming workloads deployed on FaaS (Functions as a Service) platforms.
In particular, we are investigating scheduling strategies for single-function tasks and multi-function tasks (i.e., tasks workflow) with heterogeneous granularities and priorities.

Our ongoing work is based on the knative serverless framework
